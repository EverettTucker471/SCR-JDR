# SJDR: Sparse Joint Graph Denoising and Rewiring

## Overview
We demonstrate a sparse adaptation of Joint Graph Denoising and Rewiring (JDR) from ![JDR GitHub](https://github.com/jlinki/JDR)

This adaptation implements several memory approximations and optimizations to allow feasibility for graph denoising on the ogbn-products dataset.

## Implementation
We apply SJDR as a preprocessing step in the SCR model architecture, found here ![SCR GitHub](https://github.com/THUDM/SCR)
